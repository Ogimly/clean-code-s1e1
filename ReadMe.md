[RSS task week 10](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/stage1/modules/clean-code/clean-code-s1e1.md)

> Here is a small one-page TODO-list web application. Your task is to put things in order inside the code files (refactoring) according to the outcomes: here and here (only html and css files). In this case, the functionality of the application should be detected after your changes.

**In this task, I learned:**

- clean code guideline for HTML & CSS
- handling events in DOM without selectors
- using classes to creation several types of components
- using state of application and generation task list on change
